👋 Hi, I'm @Rexopia

🚀 **Projects:**
- **[🤗 HawkLM-demo](https://huggingface.co/Rexopia/HawkLM-demo):**<br>
  A 316M parameter pre-trained model, trained on Redpajama-1T dataset. Utilizing 3.3 billion pure English tokens, excluding content related to arXiv and GitHub.
- **[🤗 HawkLM-Chat-demo](https://huggingface.co/Rexopia/HawkLM-Chat-demo):**<br>
  An instruct fine-tuned model based on HawkLM-demo. Leveraged OpenOrca dataset to grant the model preliminary conversational abilities.

🧠 **Research Interests:**

- **Knowledge and Topology Mapping in Large Language Models (LLMs):**
  Investigating how LLMs store knowledge and its topological relationships, exploring the underlying mechanisms.

- **Information Extraction through LLMs:**
  Analyzing reverse and directional extraction of information using LLM compression and learning techniques. Delving into methods to uncover hidden patterns and representations.

- **Understanding and Enhancing LLM's Inferencing Abilities:**
  A dual focus on unraveling why LLMs possess inferencing capabilities and how to further improve and exploit these abilities.

🎓 **Learning Journey:**
- I’m currently diving deep into LOADs of exciting areas within AI/NLP!

🤝 **Collaborations:**
- I'm always open to collaborating on innovative projects. Feel free to reach out if you share similar interests!
